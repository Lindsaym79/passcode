# Enter the Secret Code

A small website for NASA Goddard Space Flight Center employees who are participating in the escape room.
This website will help them input the correct passcode and see whether or not it's correct.

Note: You will know if you got 1/4 of the numbers correct or 4/4 correct, but functionality for whether or not you got 2/4 or 3/4 correct has not been implemented yet.

If you put a correct number in the incorrect spot, it will not count.

Good Luck!
