# Enter the Secret Code

A small website for NASA Goddard Space Flight Center employees who are participating in the escape room.
This website will help them input the correct passcode and see whether or not it's correct.

The code must be entered using the correct numbers in sequential order.  You will be notified if you enter 1/4 or 4/4 of the numbers correctly.  You will not be notified when you have entered 2/4 or 3/4 correctly.  

Good Luck!
